# Before you execute

  - Install Python2 and PyGame



Note:
  - In order to control the player, you will need to click on the PyGame window that should open after you run the ASCIIExplorer.py file
  - Recommend running the game in a command prompt/terminal window in full screen (Text is printed only on one half of the window)
- use "up" and "down" arrow keys to navigate the menu
- in order to enter input for the "character edit" option you need to click on the command prompt window (and then select the PyGame window after the process is complete)
